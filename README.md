## Hi, Iâ€™m Juan ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Here you'll find some of my personal projects, mostly focused on AI, data science, and algorithms.

I aim to include a README in each public repository with setup instructions and usage details.
If you run into any issues, have questions, or just want to share feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out â€” I'd love to hear from you! ðŸ˜„
